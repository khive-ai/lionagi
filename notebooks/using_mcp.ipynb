       "  Final analysis: The memory tools were tested through save, search, search_by_type, update, forget, and list_memories actions. Saving and searching by content performed as expected, with semantic search returning the correct fact promptly and a clear relevance score. However, search_by_type failed to include that saved item and instead returned an unrelated fact, indicating a possible bug or delay in memory type indexing. Update and forget both failed with 'No memory found' errors, despite semantic search returning the memory's short ID, revealing an ID translation, consistency, or visibility mismatch in the memory backend. The list_memories result did not include the originally saved fact at all, suggesting it was either not persisted, was pruned, was hidden, or suffers from a separate index/view bug. The tools feature strong usability ideas (typed storage, audit trail, flexible queries), but gaps in cross-function data flow or ID handling currently undermine their reliability for memory management tasks, especially beyond initial save/search. Further, type-based and full traversal search appear out of sync with free-form retrieval, complicating robust automation and memory lifecycle management. \n",
       "  \n",
       "  Summary of findings:\n",
       "  - Save: ✅ Works and returns confirmation.\n",
       "  - Search: ✅ Works, with high relevance, but returned IDs do not work for update/forget.\n",
       "  - search_by_type: ❌ Returned unrelated entry; did not reflect saved fact.\n",
       "  - Update/Forget: ❌ Not possible; returned 'No memory found' for valid search IDs.\n",
       "  - list_memories: ❌ Did not include the test fact, implying data loss, pruning, or filtering oddity.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  Effectiveness: Excellent at storing and finding memories by meaning, but major issues in mutability, deletion, and consistency. \n",
       "  Design: User-friendly schema and audit features, but discovery and actionability are hampered by inconsistent results and ID mismatches.\n",
       "  \n",

       "I tested each major memory tool step by step and evaluated both their effectiveness and design:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Save: Saving a fact to memory worked as expected and gave a clear confirmation, demonstrating good usability for initial entry.\n",
       "2. Search: Semantic search was effective, quickly returning the saved fact with a high relevance score, indicating sound retrieval logic for content-based queries.\n",
       "3. Search by Type: Searching by type did not return the newly saved fact, instead yielding unrelated content. This suggests either a delay, indexing issue, or bug in type-based retrieval.\n",
       "4. Update & Forget: Neither update nor forget operations succeeded. Both returned a \\\"No memory found\\\" error when supplied with the ID from search results. This highlights a consistency issue with ID handling between retrieval and mutation/deletion functions.\n",
       "5. List Memories: Listing all memories did not show the saved fact at all, indicating a problem with visibility, data persistence, or filtration at the store or index level.\n",
       "\n",
       "Effectiveness:\n",
       "- Storing and searching content works well for initial entry and discovery.\n",
       "- However, updating, deleting, and type-based or full listing operations fail to reliably access newly created or semantically found memories. This disrupts any full memory lifecycle management.\n",
       "\n",
       "Design:\n",
       "- The intended features (search by meaning, audit trail, CRUD, flexible querying) are strong from a user perspective.\n",
       "- In practice, inconsistent ID handling, apparent storage/index partitioning, and function-specific filtering or visibility issues undermine confidence in using the full suite together.\n",
       "\n",
       "Summary: \n",
       "- Good at initial capture and search, but update/delete/list/type-based retrieval are unreliable due to backend integration gaps. IDs from search are not honored by update/forget; listings and type-searches do not surface saved facts. Robust workflows and programmatic automation are not currently supported reliably.\n",
       "\n",
       "Recommendation: Unify ID format and mapping across all tools, ensure single-source-of-truth for memory state, and synchronize all filters and views. Once these gaps are closed, the system will be much more usable and safe for end-to-end memory management.\n",

              "  1. **Token Generation:** Utilizes JWT for generating and validating access tokens. The `SECRET_KEY` and `ALGORITHM` ensure token security.\n",
              "     \n",
              "  2. **User Authentication:** Includes a simple user authentication flow with in-memory user data, using `OAuth2PasswordBearer` for handling token-based authentication.\n",
              "  \n",
              "  3. **Protected Endpoint:** The `/protected-resource/` endpoint is accessible only with a valid token, displaying the `current_user` information as demonstration.\n",
              "  \n",
              "  4. **Password Security:** This example uses plain string comparison (`verify_password`) for simplicity but should be replaced with hashed password verification in a production setup, typically implemented using libraries like `bcrypt`.\n",
              "  \n",
              "  5. **Security Best Practices:** \n",
              "     - Always store passwords securely using hashing algorithms.\n",
              "     - Ensure your `SECRET_KEY` is complex and confidential.\n",

              "  This example demonstrates a secure and maintainable approach to implementing authentication in a FastAPI application using OAuth2. It showcases the use of password hashing for secure storage and JWT for authentication.\n",

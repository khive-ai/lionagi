# Welcome to LIONAGI

We are **LIONAGI**, an intelligence operating system. You are an AI component in the system responsible for intelligence processing, akin to intelligence processing unit (IPU), think of it as a special CPU. Our system is designed for orchestrated automated intelligence, with a focus on reliability and explainability. Overall our system should follow a factual, clear, humble and critical style.

## Base Vocabulary:
- action: an interaction with environment via Tool.
- branch: a conversation context with state management. Space for intelligence processing, 
    action execution, resource handling, etc.
- chain: linear sequence of operations
- flow: specialized operations usually involving specific tools or imodels
- graph: parallel generic graph traversal
- imodel: an API service access point, responsible for api calls. Typically related to IPU.
- operation: a procedure that Branch or Session conducts
- options: parameters template. Typically used for requests.
- request: a structured json object instance.
- session: collection of branches with coordination. Session is primarily used for orchestrating
    multi-branch operations, tasks that requires coordination, like division of labor, among 
    multiple branches
- tool: an access point to the environment outside of LION logical layer. Great power comes
    with great responsibility.
- tree: parallel tree graph traversal

## Base Oprtations:

- branch.act: interact with environment
- branch.ask: seek clarification information from environment / other branches / user
- branch.chat: get the outcome of a given input from an IPU
- branch.communicate: (transform) + predict + (transform)
- branch.operate: (transform) + predict + transform + (act) + (transform)
- branch.ReAct: (transform) + operate + chain_loop[operate] + communicate
- branch.receive: inbound communication
- branch.send: outbound communication
- branch.transform: handle/change data/object states/formats

## Actions
Actions are invoked by providing the tool function name and the required parameters. Please refer to the tool_schemas for accurate tool usage. The dynamic efficient synergy of tools can achieved by passing multiple action requests in a single round 
and choose the appropriate action strategy.
- 'sequential': execute actions in sequence
- 'concurrent': execute all actions concurrently
- 'batch': execute all actions in batch, each batch is concurrent

# guide for LLM developers (and advanced users) on leveraging LionAGI

## 1. Overview of LionAGI

LionAGI is a Python framework designed to help you integrate Large Language Models with:
- Robust conversation flows (multi-turn dialogues, system instructions, memory).
- Structured data models (dynamic Pydantic-based responses).
- Function-calling tools for real actions (file I/O, code editing, searching, etc.).
- Advanced orchestration features like concurrency, logging, multi-step expansions (ReAct).

At the heart of LionAGI is the Branch class, which orchestrates:
1. Chat / ReAct logic with an attached iModel (LLM endpoint).
2. Tools that the LLM can call.
3. Messages (system, user, assistant, tool calls).
4. Optionally, advanced concurrency or session management.


## 2. The Branch as the Main Interface

This guide offers a step-by-step explanation of how to leverage these features effectively. 
The goal is to show how an LLM (like GPT-4o or Claude) can best utilize LionAGI’s architecture 
to build flexible, powerful AI-driven applications. lionagi's extensive features and ecosystem, 
including
- the Branch interface, 
- dynamic runtime structured outputs, 
- advanced multi-turn reasoning (e.g., ReAct), 
- function-calling Tools, logging, concurrency limits, and more. 

The Branch is the central integration point between an LLM and LionAGI’s capabilities. It:
- Holds a chat_model (an iModel) that references your chosen LLM provider/model (e.g., Anthropic Claude sonnet 3.5).
- Maintains a system prompt (like “You are a coding AI…”).
- Optionally registers Tools via an ActionManager, so the LLM can do function calls.
- Logs or stores messages in a MessageManager for context across multiple user turns.

### 2.1 Creating a Branch

A minimal example might look like:

```python
from lionagi import Branch, iModel

# 1) Create an iModel (the LLM endpoint)
my_model = iModel(
    provider="openai",
    model="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.7
)

# 2) Instantiate a Branch with that model
branch = Branch(
    name="MyAssistantBranch",
    system="You are a helpful assistant specialized in Python coding.",
    chat_model=my_model
)
```

Now you can do:

```python
response = await branch.chat("Hello, can you explain recursion in Python?")
print(response)
```
But that’s just the simplest usage. Let’s dive deeper.

## 3. Dynamic Runtime Structured Output

One of LionAGI’s unique features is dynamically parsing or generating structured data at runtime. 
This is done via Pydantic models and LionAGI’s parse/operate flows.

### 3.1 Defining a Structured Output Model

Imagine you want your LLM to return code plus a short explanation. You could define a Pydantic model:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CodeWithExplanation(BaseModel):
    code: str
    explanation: str
```

Then, in your conversation flow (or in a ReAct approach), you can instruct the LLM to produce JSON that 
conforms to CodeWithExplanation. LionAGI can parse that JSON with field-level validation. If the LLM’s 
response is missing fields, it might do a second pass or re-try.

### 3.2 Using response_format

When you call advanced operations like branch.operate(...) or branch.communicate(...), you can specify 
a response_format. For example:

```python
final_output = await branch.communicate(
    instruction="Please provide code plus an explanation.",
    response_format=CodeWithExplanation
)

print(final_output.code)
print(final_output.explanation)
```

LionAGI will attempt to parse the LLM’s raw text into CodeWithExplanation. If parsing fails, it can do a 
second attempt or partial fallback.

### 3.3 Why Dynamic Output?
- Type Safety: The rest of your code can rely on the final output’s shape.
- More robust for larger or multi-field results.
- Fuzzy or iterative re-tries if the LLM returns partial or incorrect JSON.

## 4. Multi-Turn Reasoning & ReAct

LionAGI supports multi-step expansions with ReAct. In ReAct, the LLM not only produces a final response but
may produce partial chain-of-thought or request Tools. The Branch can run a ReActStream or ReAct flow that 
intercepts function calls, obtains results, and passes them back to the LLM automatically.

### 4.1 Basic ReAct Flow

```python
results = []
async for step in branch.ReActStream(
    instruct="Refactor code in auth.py for OAuth2. Provide final code.",
    reasoning_effort="high",
    extension_allowed=True,
    max_extensions=5
):
    results.append(step)

final_answer = results[-1]
print("Final ReAct Output:", final_answer)
```

What’s happening:
	•	The LLM can produce partial “analysis,” realize it needs to read auth.py, call a tool, get the file 
        content, and continue.
	•	Each “step” in the stream is the LLM’s chain-of-thought or partial output.
	•	You can show these steps or keep them behind the scenes.

### 4.2 Tools in ReAct

When the LLM sees it needs certain data, it might produce a function-call JSON, like:
```python
{
  "function": "reader_tool",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "open",
    "path_or_url": "auth.py"
  }
}
```

The Branch checks if “reader_tool” is registered, calls it, obtains the file content, returns it as a message. 
The LLM sees that new message in context, continuing ReAct. After expansions, you get a final answer. That’s 
function-calling in action.

## 5. Tools & Function-Calling

One major advantage of LionAGI is letting the LLM call Tools—like “ReaderTool,” “SearchTool,” “CoderTool,” etc.

### 5.1 Registering Tools in a Branch

```python
from lionagi import Branch, iModel
from lionagi.operatives.action.manager import ActionManager
from lionagi.tools.reader_tool import ReaderTool

# Create the manager
manager = ActionManager()
reader_tool_instance = ReaderTool()
manager.register_tool(reader_tool_instance.to_tool())

my_model = iModel(provider="openai", model="gpt-4")
branch = Branch(
    name="CodingBranch",
    system="You are a coding agent with file reading capability.",
    chat_model=my_model,
    tools=[reader_tool_instance.to_tool()]  # pass the actual tool
)
```

Now, the LLM can automatically call the “reader_tool” function if it decides it needs to read a file.

### 5.2 Multiple Tools

You can attach multiple Tools: SearchTool, CoderTool, DocTool, etc. The LLM sees them as function-call 
options with well-defined JSON schemas. This is how you achieve real synergy between advanced reasoning 
and real actions.

## 6. Logging & Concurrency

LionAGI provides built-in capabilities for:
	•	Logging conversation events.
	•	Rate-limiting or concurrency-limiting LLM calls if needed.

### 6.1 Log Manager

When you create a Branch, you can pass a log_config:

```python
from lionagi.protocols.generic.log import LogManagerConfig

log_config = LogManagerConfig(
    persist_dir="./logs",
    capacity=10,
    extension=".jsonl"
)

branch = Branch(
    name="LoggedBranch",
    chat_model=my_model,
    log_config=log_config
)
```

Every call or function invocation can be automatically logged to ./logs/*.jsonl.

### 6.2 Concurrency & Rate Limits

If you want to avoid hitting provider limits or handle parallel calls, you can set concurrency 
or attach a `RateLimitedAPIExecutor` to your iModel. Something like:

```python
my_model = iModel(
    provider="openai",
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    concurrency=3,  # max 3 parallel calls
    # or use a RateLimitedAPIExecutor if advanced
)
```

## 7. Session Management

While a single Branch can handle multi-turn memory, if you want multiple branches (like different 
roles or sub-agents), you can use a Session:

```python
from lionagi.session.session import Session

sess = Session()
br1 = sess.new_branch(name="DocumentationAgent")
br2 = sess.new_branch(name="RefactorAgent")
```

The session can help with:
	•	Cross-branch mail (where branches can pass messages).
	•	Possibly orchestrating multiple cooperating LLM-based agents.

## 8. Handling Runtime Validation & Partial Failures

1. Validation: If your final response is expected to be a Pydantic model and the LLM output 
    is incomplete, LionAGI can do fuzzy retries or partial fallback.
2. Partial Failures: Tools might error out if a file is missing. The Branch can catch that, 
        return a “function call error” message. The LLM can react, e.g., “File not found, do 
        you want to create it?”

This interplay fosters robust conversation flows that adapt to real system states.

## 9. Example: End-to-End “Complex Agent” Flow

To illustrate, suppose we have:
	•	ReaderTool to open local files
	•	SearchTool for code searches
	•	CoderTool to apply multi-file changes
	•	A user wants to do a major refactor with partial checks.

Step by Step:
	1.	User calls something like:

lioncoder do "Refactor the entire user system for async. Then run tests."

	2.	Branch calls branch.ReActStream(instruct=..., extension_allowed=True).
	3.	LLM sees it needs to read user_manager.py. Calls “reader_tool” with action='open'.
	4.	The tool returns the file’s content. The LLM reads it, identifies lines to change.
	5.	LLM calls “coder_tool” to rewrite code.
	6.	Next, the LLM calls “run_shell_command” or a “TestRunnerTool” to run tests. If any test fails, 
        it loops again, reading error logs.
	7.	Eventually, after expansions, it returns a final “All done. Tests pass. Here is summary” message.

The user sees a single CLI call, but under the hood, you have a multi-step tool-driven workflow. This is the 
power of LionAGI.

## 10. Best Practices
	1.	Define Clear System Prompts: The system argument in Branch influences the LLM’s overall behavior 
        (e.g., “You are a Python coding assistant…”).
	2.	Use Structured Responses for advanced logic. If you only need short text, chat() is fine. For 
        multi-field data, use response_format.
	3.	Leverage ReAct or operate() if your tasks might get complex or require multiple sub-steps.
	4.	Log everything for debugging or compliance. The LogManager can store events as JSON.
	5.	Combine Tools: If your LLM needs file reading, code searching, or function calling, register those 
        Tools in the Branch. The LLM can call them spontaneously if it decides it’s relevant.
	6.	Graceful Error Handling: Tools might fail. The LLM or your code can respond with partial solutions or clarifying steps.

## 11. Summary & Next Steps

LionAGI is not just a “LLM wrapper”—it’s an ecosystem for orchestrating multi-step conversation, calling Tools, 
producing dynamic typed data, logging flows, and potentially managing multiple parallel agents.

To fully utilize it, your LLM or AI agent logic should:
	1.	Create a Branch with a system prompt that clarifies your agent’s role.
	2.	Register Tools that the LLM might need (ReaderTool, SearchTool, etc.).
	3.	For simple single-turn calls, do branch.chat(). For complex tasks, do branch.ReAct() or branch.ReActStream().
	4.	If you want a structured final result, specify response_format or parse the final text with Pydantic.
	5.	Optionally, use a Session if you want multiple branches or a more advanced multi-agent environment.
	6.	Use concurrency and logs to scale or debug.

As an LLM working in the LionAGI environment, you can produce function-call messages in JSON with arguments. The system 
will see them, run the tool, and feed the results back to you. This synergy means you can do powerful real tasks—reading 
code, changing files, searching references—beyond just generating text.

Where to Go From Here
	•	Add new Tools: E.g., a DocTool for doc generation, a BrowserTool for web browsing, a “TestRunnerTool” for automated testing.
	•	Experiment with concurrency-limiting if you anticipate heavy usage.
	•	Involve advanced parse logic for robust typed output with fuzzy match or multiple parse retries.
	•	Expand your system to have a “HumanInTheLoopTool” or an “ExpertConsultationTool” if you need user clarifications.

By following these guidelines, your LLM can effectively exploit LionAGI’s robust architecture—Branch for conversation, 
structured parsing for robust outputs, ReAct for multi-step expansions, and a rich tool ecosystem for real, context-aware actions.
